        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of Whole Milk</li>
            <li>2/3 cups of Cane Sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoons of Sea Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Firtsly, in a medium saucepan, combine your heavy cream, whole milk, cane sugar, vanilla extract, and sea salt together. Warm over medium-low heat, whisking often, for 5 minutes, or until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is warmed through.</li>
            <li>Once everything is stirred, pour into a heatproof bowl, cover, and chill for 2 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Remove the chilled ice cream base from the fridge and whisk well. Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions, typically 20 to 30 minutes. The ice cream will be soft after churning. For firmer ice cream, transfer to an airtight container and freeze for 2 to 4 hours before serving.</li>
            <li>Don't forget; Toppings are optional if you want to enjoy your homemade ice cream with something as simple as feshly cut strawberries.</li>
